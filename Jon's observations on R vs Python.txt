Observations on R
-----------------

Some of this may be because I'm not used to it. I tried not doing this with functions to begin with, BIG MISTAKE. Using functions in a functional language is really important, who knew!

It realy isn't a general purpose langauge.

Positives
---------

* Sometimes the things you need are right there and have more simple, sensible function names than Python (e.g. colSum, rowSum, rollSum etc).

Negatives
---------

* I hated it, it wasn't anywhere near as fun as coding in Python, much more fiddly and a lot of time wasted on 
* Type hinting is a package - didn't test it but not
* Spent so long just loading data. Simple data loading processes just don't exist
* Packages for certain tasks just don't exist (eg there's no common Mode function and no decnt binary arithmetic / manipulation packages)
* There's a tiny bit more syntax fluff than Python (e.g. for(){} etc.)
